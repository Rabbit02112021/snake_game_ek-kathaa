Snake Game is a classic and iconic 2D video game that has captured the attention of players for decades. The game involves controlling a snake as it moves around a bounded area, aiming to consume food items to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls of the play area and its own tail. The Snake Game is a perfect example of simple yet addictive gameplay that challenges players' reflexes and strategic thinking.

In this project, we'll create a simplified version of the Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will feature a canvas-based play area where the snake and food items will be rendered. The snake's movement will be controlled by arrow keys, and the player's objective will be to eat as much food as possible to achieve the highest score.

Technologies Used:

HTML: To structure the game layout and canvas element.
CSS: To style the game layout and elements.
JavaScript: To implement the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and scoring.
